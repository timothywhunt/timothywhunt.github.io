In many countries government policy on funding long-term care for older people incentivises holding housing wealth over financial wealth through exempting
housing wealth from the test for means-tested government support with long-term
care costs (a “homestead exemption”). I analyse the degree to which such exemptions distort the housing demand of older people and the effects on younger people
through the housing market using the UK as my setting. I build and estimate an
overlapping generations model of the housing market where multiple generations
trade houses over the course of their life cycles while facing income, longevity and
health risk. By comparing housing market steady states with and without the
homestead exemption, I find that a budget-balanced removal of the homestead exemption would reduce house prices by 8% and increase welfare by an equivalent of
a £357 annual increase in consumption per household. The main beneficiaries are
those with less housing wealth in the initial steady state, whereas those who lose
out most are those with long-term care problems and more inherited wealth in the
initial steady state.
