Welcome!
======
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Nuffield College, University of Oxford. My research focuses on the economics of ageing and intra-family interaction. I develop and estimate dynamic structural models of people's work, care and saving choices over their life cycles to evaluate the consequences of policy interventions.

I am on the 2025-26 Economics Job Market!
